## Data Sources

This study is based on publicly available oceanographic reanalysis data and does not include any raw datasets in this repository.

### World Ocean Atlas 2018 (WOA18)

The primary data source used in this research is the **World Ocean Atlas 2018 (WOA18)**, produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

WOA18 provides objectively analyzed, quality-controlled climatological fields for key oceanographic variables, including:

- Temperature (°C)
- Salinity (psu)
- Derived density fields

The analysis uses the standard climatological normal period **1981–2010**, following World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recommendations for climatological studies.

**Key characteristics of the dataset:**
- Spatial resolution: 0.25°
- Temporal coverage: Monthly and annual climatologies
- Vertical coverage: Standard depth levels throughout the water column

### Study Area and Data Extraction

Data were extracted for the Gerlache Strait region, Antarctic Peninsula, using a set of predefined stations distributed longitudinally along the strait.

Station selection and geographic boundaries are fully described in the thesis manuscript.

### Software and Data Handling

Data visualization and analysis were primarily conducted using **Ocean Data View (ODV)**, a standard GUI-based software widely used in physical oceanography.

Additional data handling steps included:
- Conversion of NetCDF files to CSV format
- Computation of seawater density using the UNESCO equation of state
- Calculation of thermohaline stability parameters and Brunt–Väisälä frequency

Detailed methodological descriptions are provided in the thesis report.

### Data Availability

WOA18 data are freely available from NOAA:
