# Temperature and Salinity Climatology of the Gerlache Strait

This repository contains the undergraduate geology thesis:

**“Temperature and Salinity Climatology of the Gerlache Strait, Antarctic Peninsula”**

The study analyzes the climatological behavior of temperature and salinity in the Gerlache Strait using **World Ocean Atlas 2018 (WOA18)** reanalysis data for the period **1981–2010**.

The work characterizes:
- Seasonal variability of sea surface temperature and salinity
- Vertical structure of the water column
- Thermocline and halocline dynamics
- Thermohaline stability and fine structure

## Methodology

The analysis was conducted primarily using **Ocean Data View (ODV)** for visualization and profile analysis, supported by additional processing in Python and spreadsheet-based calculations.

---

## Reproducibility and Code

This thesis was developed using **Ocean Data View (ODV)**, a standard GUI-based tool in physical oceanography. As a result, no standalone source code is provided.

All analyses are based on publicly available data from the **World Ocean Atlas 2018 (WOA18)**, and the methodological details required to reproduce the results are fully documented in the thesis.

## Notes on Reproducibility

This repository does **not** include scripts, as the original analysis was performed using ODV interactive workflows and manual post-processing. The repository is intended as a **scientific reference and writing sample**, not as a computational replication package.
